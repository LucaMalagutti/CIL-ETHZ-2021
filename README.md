# Computational Intelligence Lab<br/>Collaborative Filtering Project 2021
This repository contains the code developed for the 2021 CIL CF competition by the 'SpaghettiCode' team. The team consists of Riccardo De Santi, Federico Gossi, Antonio Lopardo, and Luca Malagutti.

## Repository structure

This repository is organized as follows: the ```BayesianSVD++Submission/``` folder contains the code necessary to replicate the team's final submission on the Kaggle platform, the ```baselines/``` folder contains a subfolder for each baseline that was presented in the project report, while the ```Experiments/``` folder contains the subfolders for the models described in the Experiments section of the paper.

Each mentioned subfolder contains a ```README.md``` file which describes how to run its corresponding model.
